This is a small project that tracks development of an NT batch file that allows users of kliqfinder to process multiple networks in batches, instead of having to run each separately.

To run:
- install the batch file in the kliqfinder home directory (usually c:\kliqfind).
- create a list of paths of network files that you want to process.
- Invoke the batch, passing it the path to your data file list and the type of data in the files.
- arguments:
	- 1) path of the file that contains the list of network files you want to process.
	- 2) whether your data is 1-mode (1) or 2-mode (2).
